###  About Me

I'm **Zeynep Sıla**, a software engineering student with a strong passion for software development. I’m particularly focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using **Java**.

I’ve also started the core curriculum at **42 Istanbul**, where I’m currently deepening my knowledge of the **C programming language**. This intensive training is helping me improve in algorithms, low-level programming, and problem-solving.

I love learning new technologies, building projects, and sharing what I’ve learned with others.

I believe in working in an organized and goal-oriented way. These skills help me collaborate better in team projects and manage tasks efficiently. On this GitHub profile, I’m excited to share both my past and ongoing work with you.
